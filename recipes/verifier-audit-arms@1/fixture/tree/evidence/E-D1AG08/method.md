## Setup

The load generator posted one order change per 100 ms, and each change queued one webhook to a local receiver that records every delivery id it answers.

The receiver answered 503 on about one call in six, to keep retries running through the event under test. The event was: kill -9 of redis-server at delivery 260.

## Run

Redis ran from the stock test image with `appendonly no` added to its command line, and the retry worker read the sorted set every 200 ms. The server was killed at delivery 260 with 143 members in the set.

The run used one process of each kind on a single 4-core host, with local disks, so timings in the log say nothing about capacity.

## Reading the result

Reconciliation at the end compared the ids the service had accepted with the ids the receiver had recorded. A delivery counts as lost when it was accepted and the receiver never recorded it.

Delivery twice is not counted as a failure, because the receiver removes repeats by idempotency key.
